            <h2>Gastronomy</h2>
            <h3>1.Sarde in saor</h3>
            <p>This delectable agrodolce or sweet-sour dish is definitely our favorite. Consisting of fried sardine fillets marinated in vinegar, onions, 
                raisins and pine nuts, saor was originally conceived in the Middle Ages as a method of preservation by Venetian sailors and fishermen. 
                With modern refrigeration, preserving fish (and other foods) in this way is no longer necessary. However, the simultaneously sweet and 
                tangy flavors characterizing this preservation method were clearly very appealing to the Venetians’ taste buds and, as a result, the dish 
                lives on as a modern-day antipasto or appetizer.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>2.Baccala mantecato</h3>
            <p>Coming in at a close second is another sublime fish-based antipasto. Baccala mantecato or creamed dried cod is prepared by soaking, poaching 
                and blending the fish into a smooth mousse seasoned with olive oil, salt and pepper. You may also come across parsley and garlic in some 
                variations. It is then served spread on slices of fresh bread or grilled white polenta, a typical staple of the Veneto region.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>3.Risotto al nero di seppia</h3>
            <p>Rice is the other commonly grown staple in the Veneto region, and few dishes are more Venetian than this seafood-based risotto. The squid 
                ink in this primo or starter may confer a rather alarming and seemingly unpalatable jet-black color to the rice. This dish, though, wins 
                even the most skeptical visitors over with the distinct briny flavor of its squid, wine, onion, tomato and ink braise.</p>

            <h3>4.Risi e bisi</h3>
            <p>Our gastronomic guide to Venice would not be complete without mentioning another rice-based starter, risi e bisi or Venetian-style rice and 
                peas. On April 25, St. Mark’s Day, this primo was traditionally served as an offering to the Doge of Venice from the peasantry from the 
                lagoon islands. Not quite risotto nor quite soup, risi e bisi is made with vialone nano rice, pancetta, onion, butter, parsley and 
                surprisingly enough, pea-shell broth! If you notice fresh peas gracing the stands at the Rialto markets (generally mid-to-late spring), 
                you can be sure that it is the right time to sample this dish at a local trattoria.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>5.Bigoli in salsa</h3>
            <p>Bigoli in salsa is another signature starter dish of Venice. Bigoli, or bigoi as they called in the local dialect, are essentially long, 
                thick, whole-wheat strands of pasta resembling spaghetti. A salsa or sauce consisting of onions and salt-cured fish (sardines or anchovies) 
                is then used to accompany the pasta. Traditionally served on giorni di magro or lean days such as Good Friday and Christmas Eve, this simple 
                but delicious dish is now served all year round in Venice.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>6.Moleche</h3>
            <p>The Venetian lagoon is home to all sorts of wonderful crustaceans, making Venice the perfect place for seafood lovers. Moleche, small green 
                crabs, are a seasonal, springtime delicacy eaten after they shed their shells. Speed is required when the crabs are being harvested, as within 
                the space of a few hours they form new shells which harden after contact with water. Delightfully soft and tender, these crabs lend themselves 
                well to fried dishes and salads.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>7.Baicoli</h3>
            <p>When the Republic of Venice was a great seafaring power, sailors needed food that would last during their often long and precarious voyages. 
                Among their most important rations were the dry, oval-shaped and most importantly, long-lasting baicoli or ship biscuits. Of deceptively simple 
                appearance, preparing them is actually a very long process as they require two rises and double baking. Many a Venetian aristocrat was fond of 
                dipping baicoli in creams and dessert wines. These days, you will generally find them served with coffee and zabaglione.</p>
            <div class="container_center">

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>8.Fritole</h3>
            <p>If you are lucky enough to be visiting during the Carnevale (Carnival) period, then you must try fritole, which are sweet pastry fritters 
                traditionally prepared and eaten as part of the festivities before Lent. Made with a rich batter consisting of flour, eggs, butter, milk, 
                sugar, pine nuts and raisins, they are molded in balls, deep fried in oil and dusted with sugar. Highly recommended for those with a sweet tooth!</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>9.Wine</h3>
            <p>The Veneto region has a remarkably varied landscape and is home to a variety of microclimates, creating the perfect conditions for growing both 
                quality red and white wines. The sparkling white wine Prosecco, and other concoctions such as the Bellini and Spritz that are made with it, has become 
                quite fashionable as a pre-dinner drink lately. However, if we have to choose a white wine to accompany all the fish you will be eating here, then 
                look no further than a bottle of Soave. To accompany heartier dishes, you may wish to try reds like Valpolicella or Amarone. For a taste of 
                something really local, there are also white wines such as Orto di Venezia and Venissa. These wines are produced on the islands of the lagoon.</p>
