            <h2>Places of Interest</h2>
            <h3>1.Saint Mark's Basilica</h3>
            <p>Whether it's your first or 10th visit to Venice, the Basilica di San Marco still will impress you. This cathedral has so many details, 
                from golden domes with paintings on the inside to beautiful decorations and statues of animals on the outside. Every visit you will see 
                something different in and around the church. Tip: take the time to observe the mosaic well. More info about the number 1 things to do 
                in Venice, the 'Basilica di San Marco'.</p>

            <h3>2.Doge's Palace</h3>
            <p>The Doge's Palace, also called Palazzo Ducale, was home to the Doge, the leader of the republic that Venice used to be. This palace in 
                Gothic-style used to house political institutions. Now the Doge's Palace is a museum, where you can visit the rooms of the Doge. From the 
                Doge's Palace a bridge crosses the canal: the Ponte dei Sospiri ('Bridge of Sighs'). This bridge was used by convicts who had heard their 
                sentences to enter the prison on the other side of the canal.</p>

            <h3>3.Canal Grande & Rialto Bridge</h3>
            <p>The Grand Canal, or Canal Grande, flows through the 6 districts of Venice. Many smaller canals eventually lead to this Grand Canal. 
                This canal is beautiful to see from the shore, but a boat trip is even better to experience the Venice landmarks and sights from the water. 
                You must have done this at least once in your life. About halfway along the Grand Canal is the famous Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge). 
                This covered pedestrian bridge has many shops where you can buy your souvenirs.</p>

            <h3>4.Teatro la Fenice</h3>
            <p>You don't have to be a theater lover to appreciate the beautiful interior of this property. The velvet armchairs, the richly decorated balconies,
                 the lighting and the amazing ceiling will make a visit to this theater even without a performance special. However, in the Feniks theater, 
                 various kinds of performances take place, such as Venetian opera and ballet, as well as concerts. If you wish, you can spend 
                 an evening in Teatro La Fenice and also gaze at all the colors and paintings during the intermission.</p>

            <h3>5.Highlight: Climb the Campanile</h3>
            <p>This bell tower is located on Piazza San Marco, between the Museo Archeologico and Torre dell'Orologio. First of all, the bricks of the tower 
                stand out, but after that you will also see the base of the tower. The pillars and decorations at the entrance are very impressive, but then 
                your eyes need to the top of the Campanile. The green copper, the marble decorations and the golden angel on top make the tower complete. 
                You can climb the tower to enjoy the view over Piazza San Marco and the lagoon.</p>

            <h3>6.Cannaregio district & Campo del Ghetto</h3>
            <p>In addition to the many islands that belong to the municipality of Venezia, Venice consists of six larger districts. Cannaregio is one of 
                these districts and is the district most north. In Cannaregio you will find the Jewish quarter with synagogues and a Jewish museum. There are 
                also kosher restaurants and Jewish shops. Furthermore, the non-touristy Cannaregio district is known for the churches Madonna dell'Orto and 
                Santa Maria Assunta Detta I Gesuiti. Other sights are for exampe the palace of Ca' d'Oro. A lovely neighborhood to make a walk.</p>

            <h3>7.Bridge of Sighs</h3>
            <p>After various extensions of the Doge's Palace, the Ponte dei Sospiri - the Bridge of Sighs - was built in the 17th century. The purpose of this 
                bridge was to connect the existing Doge's Palace with the new prison that was built on the other side of the canal. The name of the Bridge of 
                Sighs refers to the last sigh of the convicts who were transported to prison.</p>

            <h3>8.Dorsoduro district</h3>
            <p>Dorsoduro is the southernmost of the six Venetian neighborhoods and known for its culture and the students. During a walk you will come across 
                several places of interest, such as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Punta della Dogana and Galleria dell'Accademia. To the east, Dorsoduro 
                borders the Grand Canal. There are also several churches to visit, such as the Santa Maria del Rosario and the San Sebastiano. More tips for 
                exploring Dorsoduro.</p>

            <h3>9.Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari</h3>
            <p>Dating back to the 14th century, this Gothic church in the San Polo district features two works of art by the painter Titian. The floors and 
                decorations inside also appeal to the imagination, but what the church is especially known for is the fact that Titian's remains are buried here. 
                The many images and colors used in the paintings contrast strongly with the austere brick exterior of the basilica.</p>

            <h3>10.Scuola Grande di San Rocco</h3>
            <p>The Scuola Grande di San Rocco is an impressive 16th-century museum that displays works of art by Tintoretto, among others. In the former 
                'brotherhood' you will mainly find works from the Renaissance period. It is a small museum and because of the period on display here, the museum 
                can be experienced as dark. Scenes on ceilings and walls are painted with dark colors, but very impressive in terms of the story they portray.</p>

            <h3>11.Island 'San Giorgio Maggiore'</h3>
            <p>On the islet, opposite of Saint Mark's Square, you will find is a church called Chiesa di San Giorgio Maggiore. This church with a white facade 
                offers beautiful views of Venice from the tower. The church is also clearly visible from Castello. There are also various works of art on display 
                in the church and there is a sailing club on the island. The island does not receive many visitors.</p>

            <h3>12.Scala Contarini del Bovolo</h3>
            <p>This building from the 15th century has been restored, preserving the special shapes of the building. The originally palace has a spiral staircase 
                along the outside and in front of the building the stairs connect to balconies. The word 'bovolo' refers to a snail, because the appearance of 
                the stairs resembles a snail shell. From the top part of the spiral staircase you have a nice view over Venice.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>13.Mercati di Rialto</h3>
            <p>This market is located on the Grand Canal and you can get all kinds of food at the Mercati di Rialto, such as vegetables, fruit, fish, meat, but 
                also spices. All the goods are beautifully displayed so that you can take a good look. If you don't want to buy anything on the market, you will 
                get a good impression of an Italian fresh market. Being able to observe how the locals buy fresh groceries for lunch or the extensive Italian 
                dinner remains a unique experience. </p>
